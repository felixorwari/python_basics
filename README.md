This repository contains **Python practice scripts** and a **sample CSV file (`car_fleet.csv`)** used for learning and demonstrating:

✅ Data types  
✅ Collections (lists, dictionaries)  
✅ Control structures (conditionals, loops)  
✅ Basic file reading  
✅ Simple data exploration using a fleet dataset

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **car_fleet.csv** – Sample CSV file containing car fleet data for practice with file reading and data handling.
- **categorize-values.py** – Prints the data type of each item in a list.
- **collections.py** – Demonstrates creating and printing dictionary values.
- **composite-data.py** – Reads and prints data from `car_fleet.csv`.
- **conditionals.py** – Shows how to use `if`, `elif`, and `else` for conditional logic.
- **for-loop.py** – Demonstrates iteration using `for` loops.
- **hello-world.py** – Prints a simple "Hello, World!" for environment and syntax testing.
- **numeric-data.py** – Demonstrates numeric operations and data handling.
- **string-data-type.py** – Demonstrates handling and manipulating strings.
- **while-loop.py** – Demonstrates iteration using `while` loops.
